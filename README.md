# Data-science-project;
This project provides an analysis of the content strategy employed by a popular streaming platform, Netflix using Python for data analysis and visualization. The goal is to explore how the platform's content release timing, language, type (shows or movies), and genres influence viewership metrics such as total hours viewed. This analysis helps uncover trends, such as seasonal spikes in engagement or the dominance of certain types of content, which can guide strategic decisions for content planning.

Key Objectives;
Analyze the distribution of viewership across different content types (e.g., shows vs. movies).
Understand how languages and regional content contribute to viewership.
Identify seasonal patterns and trends in content consumption based on release dates.
Highlight the top-performing content and their unique characteristics (e.g., genre, language).
Provide actionable insights into optimizing content strategy for improved engagement.

Tools and libraries used;
Python: For data analysis and visualization
Pandas: For data cleaning and preprocessing
Plotly: For creating interactive visualizations
